# CodeArchievements
I'm proud and energized by the archievements I've made so far 🥋🔥—and I'm ready to fight for what's next 💪🏾🚀🥊. All the success I’ve experienced is entirely rooted in obedience to the principle: ‘Six days you shall labor, but the seventh is for GOD. Remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy.’ 🙏🏾📖
