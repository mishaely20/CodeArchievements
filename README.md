# CodeArchievements
I'm proud 
and energized by the archievements I've made so far 🔥 and I'm ready to fight for what's next 🚀.

All the success I’ve experienced is entirely rooted in obedience to the principle: ‘Six days you shall labor, but the seventh is for GOD.

"Remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy." 🙏🏾📖
